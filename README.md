## GraphQL-front-end-with-Apollo-Client-and-React

This is a simple project to setup a GraphQL client and make frontend requests using Apollo Client with React JS and Typescript.

FYI, for this example, I have used Apollo Server with Node-Express-Mongo as my backend server. Please checkout the schema and resolvers from this link: https://github.com/fullStackDevShiva/GraphQL-API-with-Apollo-Server-and-Node-Js

Note: Primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how GraphQL is used from the frontend application. That is why, some of the UIs/functionalities such as like, comment and views are static and used as just placeholders only.

## Techstack/Tools used
