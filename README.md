## GraphQL-front-end-with-Apollo-Client-and-React

This is a simple project to setup a GraphQL client and make frontend requests using Apollo Client with React JS and Typescript.

FYI, for this example, I have used Apollo Server with Node-Express-Mongo as my backend server. Please checkout the schema and resolvers from this link: https://github.com/fullStackDevShiva/GraphQL-API-with-Apollo-Server-and-Node-Js

## Functionalities

1. Integration of Apollo Client into React application
2. Implementation of GraphQL Queries and Mutations from the frontend

- Query to fetch posts from the server
- Query to fetch a single post by id
- Mutation to create a post
- Mutation to update a post
